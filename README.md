# SecretHub XGO

SecretHub - XGO wraps the `secrethub-go` client with cgo exported functions so it can be called form other languages, e.g. C, C#, Python, Ruby, NodeJS, and Java. To generate the code that will then be wrapped in the library used by a certian programming language, we use `swig`.

## Roadmap

- [x] [C#](https://github.com/secrethub/secrethub-dotnet)
- [ ] Java
- [ ] NodeJS
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Ruby
